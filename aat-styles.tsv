<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300021521>	Abbasid		"Refers to the art and culture associated with the Islamic dynasty of this name that was founded in 750, when it overthrew the Umayyad caliphate. The Abbasids were a Meccan family descended from Abbas, Muhammad's uncle. Their headquarters were in Mesopotamia and they founded the city of Baghdad in 762.  Persian ideas prevailed during this period and the Abbasids ruled in great splendor as Oriental monarchs. Encouraging intense intellectual and artistic activity, many palaces and mosques were built and the production of luxury items became an industry. A unified style of art developed, inspired by ancient Persia rather than Christian Syria. The ruined city of Samarra, occupied by the Abbasids in the 9th century, is a prime example of this influence, especially in the Sassanian construction methods. Samarra is noted for its ornamental stucco, particularly the so-called 'bevelled' manner of decoration derived from Scythian-Siberian abstract design. Highly valued Chinese porcelain was imitated by potters of the period; the results were distinctly Islamic, however, with Arabic inscriptions and designs. Abbasid textiles also assumed an identifiable Islamic character. The vast empire became unwieldy and as its central administration weakened, rival caliphates were established. Although the Abbasids continued to rule part of the Islamic world until 1258, their dominance only lasted until the mid-10th century."@en	<Islamic World dynastic styles and periods>, Islamic World, The, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

In 1914 the sect split into two very separate branches, the Qadiyani and Lahori. Ahmadiyya is rejected by orthodox Muslims because Ghulam Ahmad's claim to be a prophet following Muhammad cannot coexist with the traditional belief that Muhammad was the last manifestation of God. Other unorthodox beliefs are that Jesus feigned death and actually escaped to India, where he died at the age of 120, and that the concept of jihad (holy war) can be reinterpreted as a peaceful instead of violent battle against unbelievers. After many years of demonstrations against the sect, its followers were declared heretical in 1974 and were officially banned from the orthodox Islamic community.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300021528>	Almohad	Almohades; al-Muwahhidun	"Refers to the art and culture associated with the Islamic Berber dynasty that ruled in North Africa and southern Spain (1130-1269). This period is notable because it was the first time the whole Maghrib was united under one dynasty. The Almohads rose up against the Almoravids in 1121 and conquered Marrakesh in 1147. The dynasty declined in power when it was defeated by Alfonso VIII in 1212, losing Andalusia, and in 1269 when they lost Marrakesh to the Berber Marinids. The Almohad courts at Marrakesh and Seville were centers of Islamic art and learning, especially philosophy. Almohad architecture is known for its juxtaposition of puritanically simple design with ornate decoration. Enormous congregational mosques were built in Seville, Rabat and Marrakesh. Simple interiors are relieved by voluptuous, lobed arches and other details. Repetitive use of an architectural unit such as an arcade or bay to create directed vistas and a deep sense of space is another typical feature. Austere exteriors strongly contrast with the richly decorated, gigantic square minarets (late 12th century) of the three mosques. These minarets are elaborately fenestrated and each face has different latticed designs done in raised stonework. The mosque of Tinmal, with its characteristically Maghribi T-shape, is considered to be an Almohad masterpiece. The location of the minaret behind the mihrab is an important innovation at Tinmal. Almohad mosques tend to be enlarged at the expense of their courtyards. Other arts such as bookmaking, metalwork, and luxury textiles flourished as well. Several copies of the Koran reveal that paper began to replace parchment during this period. A binding on a magnificent multi-volume Koran (1256) is the earliest dated example of gold tooling. Textiles, like bookbindings, show a taste for geometric patterns."@en	<Spanish and North African Islamic styles and periods>, <Islamic World dynastic styles and periods>, Islamic World, The, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet
<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300114633>	Almoravid	Almoravides	"Refers to the art and culture associated with the Islamic Berber dynasty that ruled in Spain and North Africa from 1054 to 1147, when it was succeeded by the Almohad dynasty. The Almoravids developed out of a puritanical movement in western Africa that appealed to North African Berbers. The Almoravid leader Yusuf b. Tashfin founded Marrakesh in 1069. From 1090 the dynasty controlled Andalusia and it was through this connection that the Umayyad art of Spain was transplanted to North Africa. Egyptian influence was also felt. Known for their puritanical fervor, the Almoravids were mostly patrons of religious architecture. They built mosques in Tilimsen and Algiers that were inspired by the mosque at Córdoba; other noteworthy mosques were built in Fès. Almoravid architects were known for their imaginative manipulation of three-dimensional space using ornamental arches and decorative vaults, architectural forms traditionally kept apart. These and other architectural forms animate their buildings instead of applied decoration. The hallmark of their distinctively Maghribi muqarnas is that the exterior reveals nothing of the internal configuration. The muqarnas vault at Fès is built over a rectangular space and so visually acts as a suspended ceiling rather than as a traditional dome. A fountain that was once part of the Great Mosque of Marrakesh is noted for its lobed and crinkled arch forms that create a powerful sculptural rhythm."@en	<Spanish and North African Islamic styles and periods>, <Islamic World dynastic styles and periods>, Islamic World, The, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Dayananda's book 'Vedabhashya' contains his interpretations of the Vedas, the earliest Hindu scriptures. Arya Samaj promotes a moral vision of kindness and goodwill to all. Arya Samaj, now a worldwide organization, is also opposed to the traditional Hindu caste system and works to remove religious and social injustices. Arya Samaj followers also introduced the novel idea of converting to Hinduism people of other faiths. In 1893 there was a split between conservative and liberal followers who disagreed on whether to advocate traditional or modern forms of education and on whether to advocate vegetarianism or freedom of diet. The movement became nationalistic and was in conflict with Sikhs and Muslims, especially in the Punjab around the time of the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947."@en	Hinduism, religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

Aten (or Aton), the Egyptian word for the sun disc, was depicted as a round solar disc with rays that end in hands. Aten was originally an aspect of the sun god Re but had begun to be worshipped in its own right during the reign of Akenaton's two predecessors. Akhenaton believed that Aten was the only deity worth worshipping and he presecuted other deities such as the prominent Amun. Akhenaton was considered the sole intermediary between Aten and the world. An interest in art flourished during this time, and the resulting painting and sculpture is more naturalistic than earlier Egyptian art. Follows of Atenism worshipped the actual sun as a giver of life, beauty, and love through its light and warmth. Atenism was disruptive among the ruling classes and had little impact on the beliefs of the common people; the new religion collapsed shortly after Akhenaton's death and the old gods were reinstated."@en	religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

The architectural style of the temple marks the first establishment of the stepped pyramid form and served as the model for later temple-mountain complexes. The temple complex features a five-tiered construction cut directly  from rock, tower-sanctuaries in quincunx formation, axially-oriented staircases at specific angles leading to shrines, secondary brick shrines, terraces, four images of the sacred bull Nandi guarding the base of the pyramid, and staircases flanked by seated lion monuments. Sculpture of this style exhibits a movement away from the more fleshy, polished styles toward more angular, bony, almost inhuman bodily depictions of deities in frontal stances. Sculptural figures are characterized by their broadness in scale, square jaws, abstract placid facial expressions, linearity in facial details, and lack of graceful movements."@en	Angkorean styles, Angkorean, Cambodian (culture or style), Southeast Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Most of these rugs have a blue field, and characterized by either an avshan (scattered floral sprig) or harshang (crab) design.

Influenced by John Constable and 17th century Dutch landscape painters, the Barbizon painters were concerned with depicting naturalistic settings and the dignity of peasant life. Theodore Rousseau, the unofficial leader of the School, moved to the Fontainebleau region in 1841 and began acquiring disciples, such as Jean-Francois Millet, who would later become the most renown member of the Barbizon School, and whose work had more overt socialist overtones. Because of their non-traditional approach to subject matter, it took until the 1850's for the individual members of the School to become critically accepted. Rousseau, in fact, had been rejected by the Salons so often he garnered the nickname 'le grande refuse'. After several decades of success, the movement lost popularity with Millet's death in 1875.  Though often seen as a transitional movement between classical landscape painting and Impressionism, the Barbizon School's importance lies with their plein-air landscape technique and humble, unpretentious subject matter."@en	<modern European fine arts styles and movements>, <modern European styles and movements>, European, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

The Basilian monastic community has been highly influential in the Byzantine community over the centuries, comparable to the Benedictine influence within the Western monastic community. St. Basil, theologian and archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia (modern Turkey), created his monastic rule between 358 and 364. St. Basil's simple yet strict rule asks followers to practice community living and advocates ascetic practices as a way to serve God more perfectly. His rule avoids the extreme asceticism of the desert hermits. Implied by St. Basil are vows of chastity and poverty, anticipating the later Western monastic systems, and aid to the poor is also called for. Attached to the monasteries should be schools for children in which the students can be tested for a possible religious vocation. St. Basil's rule was revised in the 9th century by St. Theodore of Studios. The Basilian order should not be confused with a Latin-rite congregation of the same name that was founded in France in 1822 but later active mainly in Canada; the members of this congregation devote themselves to educating children."@en	Christian orders, Christianity, religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

It was given definitive form in the 16th century in Anatolia (Turkey) by Bālim Sulṭān. While originally a Sufi order within Orthodox Sunnite Islam, during this period it became more syncretic and adopted tenets of the Shi'a sect. Aspects of Christianity such as confession, absolution and initiation practices were also incorporated as a result of contact with Christians. Bektashi is Shi'a in that it recognizes the twelve imāms (spiritual leaders) and venerates Ali but it is different from most other Muslim orders in that it regards traditional Islamic rituals as hypocrisy and, like many Sufi orders, is lax about observing daily Muslim laws. Bektashi allows women to take part in rituals without wearing a veil. Bektashi mystical writings are an important contribution to Sufi poetry. Through its connection with the Janissaries, an elite Ottoman military corp recruited from Christian areas, Bektashi maintained political importance from the 15th century until shortly after 1826 when the Janissaries were disbanded. The Bektashi order was dissolved in Turkey in 1925 along with all other Sufi orders but it survived in Albania until religion was banned there in 1967. It is still found in some communities in Turkey, Albanian regions of the Balkans, and the United States. Followers wear white caps with 4 or 12 folds, the 4 representing the 4 gates of Islam and the 12 representing the 12 imāms."@en	Islam, religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

Woven on a woolen foundation in the symmetrical knot, these carpets are said to be double-warped. This refers to the way the warps are strung closely together, and alternate weft shoots are pulled so tight that the warp lies on two levels, one almost precisely behind the other. The structure is unusual in that the weft is passed three times between rows of knots. This is also a Kerman characteristic. Many Bijar carpets have clumsy medallion decorative schemes in which the medallion and corners are ornamented but the balance of the field remains a solid red or yellow. Other examples show repeat patterns, including the herati, in which a diamond lattice peeps through a tangle of stylized flowers. From Bijar come a remarkable number of vagirehs, or weavers' samples used as models for large carpets, that show portions of several patterns and borders."@en	West Persian textile styles after the Mongols, Persian textile styles after the Mongols, Iranian Islamic styles after the Mongols, <Iranian Islamic styles and periods after the Mongols>, <Islamic World dynastic styles and periods>, Islamic World, The, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Unlike the local sculpture of the 17th century, most early Bilaspur paintings are not religious. Instead, most are portraits, and they are indebted to Mughal painting for their naturalism. Later Bilaspur painting retains the refinement of the Mughal influence but the subject matter is more commonly traditional subjects such as 'Ragamala' illustrations and devotional works. By the end of the 18th century, outside influences from Guler and Kangra dominated Bilaspur painting and in the first few decades of the next century, the style showed little connection to its origins and declined."@en	Pahari, Rajput, Indian painting styles, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

The central belief was that humanity and the visible, material world were created by the devil. Bogomils were hostile to most aspects of the Orthodox church as well as to civil authorities.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300264544>	Bon (religion)	Bonpo; Bon po; Bön (religion)	"Refers to an indigenous religion of Tibet that is, along with Buddhism, one of the two main religions of the country. Many aspects of Bon were mixed with the Buddhist traditions introduced from India in the 8th century and gave Tibetan Buddhism much of its distinctiveness. Disagreement amongst the ruling class of Tibet in the 8th and 9th centuries resulted in the noble families choosing Bon and the ruling house choosing Buddhism. The religion became organized around the 11th century largely thanks to the Buddhist concern for written works. Besides surviving in many aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, Bon continues to thrive in the northern and eastern frontiers of Tibet. It is unclear how much continuity there is between ancient and modern Bon. The features of ancient Bon are hard to determine because all early description are Buddhist and what is known of Bon today is heavily influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. Ancient Bon seems to have featured animism, shamanism, and the practice of magic rites. The Bon gods of the atmosphere, the earth, and subterranean regions were incorporated into the Buddhist pantheon as lesser deities. There is evidence of a cult of divine kingship in which the kings are seen as manifestations of the sky divinity; this belief may be the root of the reincarnated lamas of Buddhism. Bon oracular priests have as their counterpart the Buddhist soothsayers. Aspects of Bon doctrine are virtually identical to that of Tibetan Buddhism, including doctrine of buddhahood and the bodhisattva ideal. Particularly noteworthy are the dzogchen beliefs of Bon that are shared with the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism; these beliefs hold that there is an ineffable state beyond all Buddhas and all manifestation. The Bon monastic system is also almost identical to that of the Geluk school. Nevertheless, believers in Bon rigorously guard their non-Buddhist image. Shenrab is considered the founder of the religion and the historical Buddha Shakyamuni is said to be a manifestation of him. Bon scriptures are of one of two groups: the 'Kanjur,' containing myths, doctrines, and biographies of Shenrab; and 'Katen,' containing commentary and ritual and iconographic works. The name Tibet is derived from Bon."@en	religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

Only purified souls will continue to exist in this golden age and these souls will live as deities in a state of complete happiness. Followers recommend a lifestyle of vegetarianism, abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes, and celibacy with a large emphasis placed on meditation and yoga as ways to attain mental union with God. Their ideas are circulated in the form of messages or 'murlis' that are delivered daily at Brahma Kumari centers throughout the world.

After the death of her husband, Bridget dedicated her life to prayer and experienced visions, one of which was to found the Order of the Most Holy Savior.  Shortly after Bridget's death, her daughter, St. Catherine of Sweden, became the first abbess of the original monastery in Vadstena, Sweden. Other monasteries followed, each with no more than 60 nuns. Attached to each was a parallel community of monks who shared the same liturgical life under the governing of the abbess. Brigittine contributions to Scandinavian culture include one of the first printing presses, located at Vadstena Abbey.

Mughal influence was particularly strong in this Rajasthani school which lasted from the 17th to the end of the 19th century. Bundi painting also shows a likeness to painting of the Deccan in the south, a region with which the rulers of Bundi and Kotah were often in contact. Painting usually took the form of palace wall painting or miniature painting. Moving figures, rounded head forms, symmetrical, fan-shaped plantain trees, lush vegetation, dramatic night skies, and a distinctive way of depicting water (light-colored swirls on a dark background) are all hallmarks of the Bundi school. The painting produced under Rao Bhao Singh (reigned 1658-81) and Rao Anurad Singh (reigned 1681-95) was particularly distinctive, mature, and delicate; it also had a broader repertoire. Painting in Kotah saw important patrons in Rao Jagan Singh (reigned 1658-84), Maharao Umed Singh (reigned 1770-1819), Maharao Ram Singh (reigned 1827-66), and Maharao Shatru Sal (reigned 1866-89); particularly popular were lush paintings of hunting scenes involving the ruler, both in wall and miniature formats."@en	Rajasthani (culture or style), Rajput, Indian painting styles, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Calvinism stresses the sovereignty of God over all aspects of life and the Bible as the sole rule of faith. Justification by faith alone is another central concept. Although predestination was not a leading axiom of Calvin's theology, it was heavily emphasized by his early followers, in part to distinguish themselves from followers of Luther. The Helvetic Confession (1566) and the Synod of Dort (1618-19) were important moments in the history of Calvinist theology; the latter affirming the 'five points of Calvinism': total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, and the final perseverance of the saints. By the mid-17th century, Calvinism had spread from France and Holland to England and Scotland where it was espoused by the Puritans and taken to New England. While it has suffered rationalistic attacks, it influenced much church life and there has been a Neo-Calvinist renewal in modern times led by the theologian Karl Barth.

An independent offshoot of the Benedictines, it was begun as part of the monastic reform movement of the 11th and 12th centuries. The order prescribes a combination of the solitary life of a hermit with an austere version of the common life of a monk. Although a part of the Benedictine confederation, the Camaldolese sees itself as rooted in the Desert Fathers and Mothers, which precede both Benedict and Romuald. Beginners live in the monastery and the more proficient live in the hermitage; together they form one unit. This ideal union was not always followed and independent monasteries and hermitages were founded. In 1935 the two branches were reunited.

In 1452 the friars were joined by Carmelite nuns (Sisters of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt. Carmel), the Carmelite Second Order. The Carmelites do not have a founding figure as do many orders, but they consider Elijah and Mary, both central to Carmelite consciousness, as their founders. Important reform figures are St. Teresa of Avila, reformer of the female order in 1562, and St. John of the Cross, who similarly reformed the male order later in the century.

They played an important role in the monastic-reform movement of the 11th and 12th centuries; it is itself, however, the one form of communal religious life that has not experienced reform. Houses are found in many parts of Europe although membership is relatively small.

In the Middle Ages the term came to refer to a highly organized sect that rejected sacraments and believed in a neo-Manichaean dualism in which good and evil were separate spheres and the material world was evil. Cathars led rigorously ascetic and celibate lives. The faithful were divided into two groups: the 'perfect' and the 'believers.' The perfect were set apart from the latter group by a ceremony of initiation called the 'consolamentum.' The sect was seen as a serious threat to the Roman Catholic Church in the 13th and 14th centuries, particularly in southern France. The Cathars declined in the 14th century due to repression by the Inquisition, disagreement amongst followers regarding dualism, and the newly appealing piety and devotion of the Franciscans. Although the term is sometimes used interchangeably with 'Albigenses,' this is actually a branch of the Catharistic movement.

The school was favored by the Mongols and its second patriarch, Ch'iu Ch'ang-ch'un, was invited into Central Asia to preach to Genghis Khan. The school was immensely popular and its establishments of celibate monks continued to be active into the 20th century, with the famous White Cloud Monastery at Beijing as headquarters.

After Suun was executed by the government, his successors Ch'oe Si-hyong and Son Piyong-hi fostered the movement until it grew to become a major Korean religion. The Chondogyo scriptures are the writings of the three founders. The religion views humans as bearers of divinity and as such, humans must treat one another 'as God.' Chondogyo stresses the universality of God and calls for a cooperative kingdom of God on earth based on faith, simplicity, steadfastness, and sincerity. There is no concept of eternal reward because the religion's aim is solely to bring righteousness and peace to the world. There are five recommended practices: chanting of a formula every night at nine o'clock; the use of water as a symbol of purity; attending a Sunday worship service; offering rice to the church on a regular basis; and praying in different ways. Chondogyo had an important role in modernizing Korea after 1894. It also opposed Japanese imperialism after 1919 and did not acquiesce to communism in North Korea after 1945.

In the 17th century, elements of Basohli painting are incorporated into Chamba painting with richer, warmer colors and more stylized and decorative depictions of trees. While some Chamba painting became increasingly influenced by the Basohli school in the early 18th century, other contemporary paintings are done in much more indigenous style. The presence of artists from Jammu is also felt in the early 18th century, most noticeably in the rectangular and squarish facial types. Other influences came from Mughal and Guler painting. The especially influential Guler artists arrived in Chamba circa 1770, bringing with them their poetic and expressive style as well as a preference for romantic subject matter.

The name was adopted during the American Civil War to justify the follower's pacifism. The doctrines of the Trinity and of the pre-existence of Christ were rejected by Thomas. Christadelphians believe in the complete accuracy of the Bible. At the center of Christadelphian belief is millennialism. Specifically, it is believed that Christ will come again to establish a theocracy based in Jerusalem. Christadelphians do not agree on whether all people will be resurrected although it is most commonly believed that anyone other than a true believer will go to oblivion.

Eddy, a semi-invalid who was interested in cures not involving medicine, claimed a recovery from a bad injury without medical assistance in 1866. Afterwards, she devoted herself to restoring the healing emphasis of early Christianity. In 1875 she finished writing the first edition of the 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.' This work and the Bible are the principal texts of the movement and importance has been laid on establishing reading rooms where these works can make their own appeal to readers. The 'Christian Science Monitor' is also published by the denomination. Christian Science believes that ignorance is at the root of human unease and thus 'dis-ease.' Instead of seeking medical treatment, special Christian Science healers are to be consulted for spiritual healing. Health, happiness, and holiness can be restored by applying to all aspects of life practices and attitudes in keeping with the principal of divine harmony.

Cistercians abide by a strict interpretation of St. Benedict's rule and emphasize solitude, poverty, uniformity, and especially manual labor. The order was prominent during the Middle Ages, particularly under the leadership of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153), with over 500 houses in Europe by the 13th century, but declined thereafter. The Cistercian's emphasis on manual labor, particularly farm labor, meant that the order played an important role in the economic progress of the 12th century and in the development of farming and marketing techniques. Reform movements occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries and the order ultimately divided into the Order of the Reformed Cistercians of the Strict Observance (often popularly called the Trappists) and the Cistercians of Common Observance. Today, there is a great amount of diversity among the monasteries of both orders and there has been a revival of literary work in both. Strict Observance is active in France, England and Poland while Common Observance is active in the United States and parts of Western Europe.

The order is named after the town of Cluny in Burgundy, site of the celebrated abbey of the same name that was founded in 910 by Duke William the Pious of Aquitaine. The new order returned to strictly observing the rule of St. Benedict during a time of general monastic laxity. The Cluniac reforms were imitated by other monasteries and a succession of abbots gradually built up an impressive network of monasteries throughout western Europe that followed the strict Cluniac customs. The Cluniac order, free of feudal control itself, sought to eliminate feudal warfare; it supported the Truce of God and the Peace of God, which respectively restrict fighting and range of conduct. Cluniacs are also credited with integrating monks and society. The most important Cluniac abbots were St. Odon of Cluny (879-942) and St. Hugh of Cluny (Hugues de Semur; 1049-1109). St. Odo gained for Cluniac houses (called priories) exemption from all but papal authority, a centralization previously unknown in the Benedictine order. Under St. Hugh medieval monasticism reached its apogee and Cluny gained fame as a spiritual center of Western Christianity. While Hugh was abbot almost 2,000 more monasteries were founded in Italy, England, and Spain and in 1055 he founded the first Cluniac convent."@en	Benedictine, Christian orders, Christianity, religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

The Community of Christ came out of one of the factions that developed after Joseph Smith's death in 1844. A group of Mormons rejecting Brigham Young's leadership instead claimed that Smith's son was the rightful successor; they did not follow Young to Utah. The leaders of the denomination were descendants of the founder up until 1996. This denomination actually rejects the appellation Mormon because of the association with polygamy. Followers feel that polygamy is not in harmony with the original tenets of the church or with the teachings and practices of Smith. Many of its doctrines are similar to those of other Mormon denominations but the church can be described in general terms as more liberal and more ecumenical. For instance, the Community of Christ allows women to be ordained, rejects the practice of 'blood atonement' called for by Young, and allows the general public to attend its services."@en	Mormonism, Christianity, religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

Critiquing the concept of art as commodity, the style is characterized by an emphasis on communicating an idea and the artist's intent, rather than the production of the artwork itself, often including documentation referring to the creation process, such as maps, photographs, and notes. A genre of art in which the ideas or concepts that a work expresses or refers to are considered to be its defining characteristic, and the finished material result, if it exists at all, is regarded primarily as a form of documentation rather than as the art work. The genre emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, arising at virtually the same time in North America, Europe and Latin America, and helping to inspire the acceptance of nontraditional media such as photographs, architectural drawings and performance art as art of equal status as traditional painting and sculpture. It directly inspired the medium of artists' books as an individual type of art. The term entered common art parlance through an article by Sol LeWitt, \"Paragraphs on Conceptual Art\" published in Artforum in 1967."@en	<post-1945 fine arts styles and movements>, <international post-1945 styles and movements>, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Since the 5th century these Christians have been Monophysites, meaning that they acknowledge only one nature in Christ. Apart from the Monophysite question, the Coptic and the Eastern Orthodox churches agree regarding doctrine. Services are almost entirely conducted in Arabic and the service books, using the liturgies attributed to St. Mark, St. Cyril of Alexandria, and St. Gregory of Nazianzus, are written in Coptic (the Bohairic dialect of Alexandria), with the Arabic text in parallel columns. After the 1890s the church devised a democratic system of government, led by the patriarch who lives in Cairo. Outside of Egypt, there are a few Coptic Orthodox churches in the Holy Land and a Coptic bishopric in Khartoum, Sudan. The Ethiopian, Armenian, and Syrian Jacobite churches are in communion with the Coptic Orthodox Church. There is an impressive body of Coptic religious art and the church is known for its vital system of schools.

A number of well-known vase painters such as Onesimos and Psiax experimented with the technique. Coral-red was made by adding yellow ocher to the black gloss, making the gloss porous and thus deep orange-red in color after the reoxidizing phase of firing. The coral-red technique was most typically found on stemless cups and phialai dating from after the Persian Wars, on which the red body contrasts strikingly with the black lip and handles. They may have been made in  Athens under the influence of Persian metalwork and it is possible that the color was intended to evoke gold. Since the coral-red gloss did not adhere well to the vase's surface, it was never a widespread technique and it was eventually abandoned.

In Greek architecture it is characterized by a form that is lighter and more ornate than Doric or Ionic, a bell-shaped capital with acanthus stalks emerging to support graceful volutes, and a column that is seated on a base and usually fluted. It was the most common of Greek styles in Roman architecture, and in Roman and later architecture the style was often modified.

It is characterized by a renewed interest in medieval piety, an expressive use of nature, the relationship of the human figure and events to nature, and the introduction of landscape as a primary theme in art. The term was coined by Theodor von Frimmel (1853-1928), who believed that painting in the Danube River region around Regensburg, Passau, and Linz possessed common characteristics; the style seems to exist even though leading artists did not form a school in the usual sense of the term, since they did not work in a single workshop or in a particular center.

Painted decoration gave way in the Late Dawenkou period (ca. 2900-ca. 2400 BCE) to surface treatments such as cord and basket impressions.

Many palm-leaf manuscripts survive with miniature paintings; the text most often decorated is 'Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita' ('Perfection of wisdom in 8000 sections'). The viewpoint is usually frontal and besides a few trees the background is usually empty. Because of their small size, never more than 80mm square, they are not iconographically complex; they generally consist of conventional icons of Buddhist gods and goddesses with little narrative representation. Most surviving manuscripts are stylistically linked to those in the Pala style. The monasteries themselves were probably frescoed and decorated with banner paintings which have not survived.

Emperors of the Sima family were not able to reconquer the north which remained under the rule of various groups known collectively as the Sixteen Kingdoms; an exception was the area of modern Sichuan province which was annexed in 347, opening up a route to central Asia. Although not a politically strong period in Chinese history, it was a brilliant time for literature and the arts. The capital of Jiankang flourished as a cultural center visited by Buddhist missionaries and merchants from Southeast Asia and India. One of the earliest known Buddhist gilt-bronze images was cast in 338 in imitation of a Gandharan model. Wang Xizhi, the most influential calligrapher in Chinese history, was active during the this period. Eastern Jin ceramic forms are more innovative than those of the Western Jin.

The Eastern Zhou period is said to have begun when the Zhou, fleeing attacking tribes, moved their capital from Xi'an to Luoyang in 771 BCE.  This geographical break with the preceding Shang dynasty was reflected in the art of the Eastern Zhou period. Late Eastern Zhou art, in particular, displays a remarkable diversity and skill. Low-fired burial figurines (mingqi) were used more, possibly influenced by Confucian dictum against human sacrifice. Low-fired green lead-glazed wares, soft, polished black wares, and some high-fired glazed wares were made in the Eastern Zhou period. Brightly painted ceramics were made to imitate newly popular lacquerware while other ceramics were made to imitate bronzes. Molded and decorated ceramic tiles and bricks were produced. Jade carving, which had decreased in the Western Zhou period, became important again as burial objects and objects of personal adornment. Bronzes became more secular and were often given as wedding presents for household decoration. Bronze bells and mirrors became popular. Totemic animals and monsters were replaced by colorful, formalized decorative schemes. The earliest examples of paintings on silk have been discovered in Eastern Zhou tombs.

The Fatimids, of the Shi'a sect, traced their ancestry back to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad. The Fatimids had many rivals to contend with as well as the challenge of the Crusaders. Fatimid art is noteworthy for its internationalism: it bridges the east and west of the Islamic world and it was open to the Hellenic heritage of the Mediterranean and to some ideas from Christian powers to the north. Although Fatimid artists continued to use materials and techniques developed by the Tulunids, the abstraction favored by the Tulunids was replaced by an interest in exploring the tradition of figurative representation inherited from Iraq. Painting, book illustration, wood and ivory carving, and glass, ceramic and textile design bear figurative decoration unparalleled in contemporary Islamic art. An interest in naturalism is also evident. The iconography of Fatimid art is often indebted to Abbasid court art. Just as figural traditions were being developed, so were designs based on infinite systems of linear pattern; this form of ornamentation became one of the most successful forms of abstract Islamic art. Figural art was inappropriate for religious buildings, which were instead decorated with a vigorous new style of stone carving typically featuring elegant inscriptions in a distinctive form of kufic script elaborated with foliate and floral elements. A conch shell motif known from late antiquity was popular with the Fatimids, as seen on the façade of the mosque of al-Akmar. Nothing has survived of the two Fatimid palaces that stood in the center of Cairo but accounts of them attest to their magnificence."@en	<Egyptian, Syrian and Iraqi Islamic styles and periods>, <Islamic World dynastic styles and periods>, Islamic World, The, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Nuances in the luster are seen in the wares made during the Fatimid period, although each piece only has one luster. The decorative motifs become more rich and varied as well and, as they are drawn from many different cultures, demonstrate that Fatimid Egypt was open to influences from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. Animals in scrolls, fish, birds, and good luck inscriptions in decorative Kufic are popular; fantastic animals and human figures are also favored just as are more schematic motifs such as heart palmettes. Some of the animals depicted have been interpreted as lunar, solar or astrological symbols. No tiles, only vessels, were made in Egypt. Fostat lusterware seems to have stopped being made in the Mamluk period when potters favored relief decoration.

Freemasonry incorporates traditions and rituals that make symbolic use of or reference to the tools of medieval stonemasons, notably the square and compasses. In medieval Europe, like other craft organizations of the period, many medieval associations of masons whose members included freemasons, had developed elaborate secret rituals for imparting the knowledge of their craft and for the initiation of new members. These rituals continued to evolve during the early modern period. In 16th-century Scotland Freemasonry began to incorporate elements of contemporary Hermetic thought.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300018889>	Gandhara	Gandharan; Greco-Buddhist	"Refers to the culture of the Ghandara region of India, the area between the Upper Indus River and Kabul, under the Kushan dynasty; it particularly refers to the Buddhist architecture and sculpture of the 2nd through the 6th centuries CE. Its style reflected the cosmopolitan connections of its patrons: it was heavily influenced by 2nd-century Hellenistic art of Egypt and Syria. In turn, it gave rise to styles of art in central Asia, Wei China, and Japan. Gandhara monasteries and stupas were very ornate, with Western decorative elements such as acanthus capitals, Hellenistic comedy masks, and putti. The stupa form itself changed in Gandhara: the dome became taller, the railings larger and more elaborate, and the tiered umbrella unit was enlarged until it towered over the entire structure. Sculptural figures were usually heavily draped in toga-like attire and their musculature was typically emphasized; sculptures were usually stuccoed and vividly painted as well. Simultaneously with sculptors in Mathura, Gandhara sculptors supplied a Buddha icon for the emerging Buddhist faith; they also contributed to the development of the Bodhisattva image. A great deal of Gandhara sculpture survives, all of it quite homogenous in style. Important sites were at Shahji-ki Dheri, Takht-i-Bahai, the Taxila region, Sar Dheri, and Sahr-i-Bahlol. The extreme north-west part of Gandhara extended into what is now Afghanistan; Gandharan-style religion and art continued in that area until at least the 8th century."@en	Kushan, <Indian dynastic styles and periods>, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

It geographically covered western Shaanxi province, Gansu and Qinghai provinces, but since the most striking pottery comes from sites in Gansu, the culture takes this name. Gansu culture falls into three major phases: Majiayao (ca. 3300-ca. 2100 BCE), Banshan (ca. 2800-ca. 2300 BCE) and Machang (ca. 2000-ca. 1800 BCE). These were followed by the Qijia (ca. 2000-ca. 1600 BCE), Xindian, and Shajing phases. The finest Gansu ceramic vessels are thin-bodied and light, with a variety of boldly painted decoration. Clay was carefully selected and prepared and painted decoration was done in earth pigments probably applied with a soft brush.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300019005>	Garhwal	Garwhal	"Refers to a regional school of Pahari miniature painting associated with Garhwal in the extreme southeast of the Punjab Hills; the Garhwal school flourished from the second half of the 18th to the late 19th century, particularly in its capital city of Srinagar. While the school was not prolific, it made a large contribution to Pahari painting. Characteristic elements include vigorous line, precise drawing, brilliant color, expressive figures, strong compositions, and luxuriant and atmospheric landscapes. The influence of Guler painting is heavily debated as there are a number of stylistic similarities between the two schools. Painters from Guler probably settled in Garhwal and artists from Garhwal may have traveled to other painting centers for apprenticeship as well. Garhwal retained its individuality, however. The Shaivite crescent-shaped marks on foreheads are commonly and consistently found on figures in Garhwal paintings while they are not usually seen in other Pahari painting. Other distinguishing features include pairs of tigers, leopards and birds; lotus ponds; and flowers with pointed ends. Painting activity gradually declined in the 19th century as Garhwal was affected by foreign invasion and earthquake."@en	Pahari, Rajput, Indian painting styles, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Newbery (1853–1946) became director of the Glasgow School in 1885, his teachings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement that stressed an art that combined functionalism with beauty while encouraging individuality and experimentation among its students. The journal “The Hobby Horse” (begun in spring 1884), expressed a desire for the unification of old and new and a harmonious relationship between abstract lines and masses. The style was further developed through the increasing popularity of Celtic revivalism taking root in Glasgow at the time.

The ruling house of Guler served the Mughal empire which certainly affected the development of painting in Guler, since paintings were often exchanged and given as gifts. The family of Pandit Seu (early 18th century) was a celebrated artistic family originating from Guler as were the Dhumun and Purkhu families. Pandi Seu himself may have been responsible for the integration of Pahari intensity with Mughal naturalism and atmospheric effects that became the norm in Guler painting. Later artist families continued to be influenced by Pandit Seu and may have been distantly related to him.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300018904>	Gupta		"Refers to the culture of the Gupta period in North Central India from the early 4th century to the late 5th century, considered to be the 'classical' period of Indian art. The Gupta period saw an outpouring of science, visual art, music, and literature, and had its zenith during the reign of Chandra Gupta II (375-415 CE). Some of India's earliest surviving paintings were created during this period at the Buddhist caves at Ajanta in the Deccan; the paintings are characterized by lively calligraphic line and life-like, contemporary details. The renowned Gupta sculptural style probably grew out of the Kushan style; by the end of the 4th century a distinctive Buddha icon had developed, characterized by monumental simplicity and refined realism. The tension of earlier Mathuran sculpture has been replaced by a calm and tranquil mood connoting a spiritual other worldliness that is a hallmark of the Gupta Buddhist style. The many sculptural finds at Sarnath include a group of sculptures known as the 'wet Buddhas' in which clinging drapery and webbed fingers are distinguishing Gupta features. During this period, Hindu art emerged into prominence; the earliest and most dramatic example of Gupta Hindu art is the rock-cut shrine at Udayagiri of 401. The sculptor of the reliefs of the ruined Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh took the Buddhist style of Sarnath and applied it to a Hindu motif with striking results. Very little Gupta art, however, remains as much of the art, both Buddhist and Hindu, was destroyed during the invasions of the Huns and the advent of Islam."@en	<Indian dynastic styles and periods>, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Hongshan's relatively complex society was based on villages in a wide distribution, with contact with the Yangshao culture of the Central Plain. The Hongshan had sites along rivers in the grassland and ceremonial sites and elaborate burial grounds in the hills and forest. Realistic animal and female human clay figurines have been found at ceremonial sites; the female figurines may indicate a matriarchal society. Dwellings are large and built on high terraces; graves are of the cairn type and often include gifts of pottery and jade carvings. Polished stone tools and red and grey pottery, sometimes decorated with geometric patterns, were produced. The carved and ornamented jade objects of the Hongshan are particularly noteworthy since most Neolithic jades are without surface decoration.

Wari was probably the centre of a militaristic empire that dominated much of the Peruvian highlands and coast during the earlier part of the Middle Horizon. Its influences are seen especially in the Late Nazca (Ica) culture of the southern coast and at Pachacamac on the central coast. The most distinctive decorative motif on Huari pottery is the Doorway God, a stylized, anthropomorphic figure often represented in front view with a rectangular face and rayed headdress. This motif is also found at Tiwanaku. Wari architecture features large enclosures constructed of stone masonry. Monumental temple sculpture is naturalistic and depicts both male and female figures with elaborate hairstyles. \"Wari\" and \"Huari\" are often used interchangeably but usage of \"Wari\" has become more common in museum collections."@en	Early Intermediate Period, <Pre-Columbian Andean styles and periods>, <Pre-Columbian South American styles and periods>, Pre-Columbian (American), Americas, The, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

It developed in the eastern Greek Aegean islands and on the coast of Asia Minor, probably influenced by Jewish and Phoenician architecture that employed \"lily capitals.\" Stone versions are found in Greece in the sixth century BCE, though wooden examples may have existed earlier. In ancient Greek architecture it is characterized by a form that is more delicate than Doric, a capital composed of two lateral volutes, a column that often has an Attic base and a shaft often with twenty-four semi-circular flutes with fillets between them, and an entablature that is more variable than Doric, including an architrave with overlapping courses, decorative moldings above, and a continuous carved frieze and/or row of dentils under the cornice. In Roman and later architecture the style was often modified and is recognized primarily by the volutes of the capital. It is distinct from \"Ionic order,\" since an architectural order refers strictly to the specific system or assemblage of parts that is subject to uniform established rules and proportions, regulated by the role that each part has to perform."@en	Aegean architecture styles, Aegean styles, Aegean, Mediterranean (Early Western World), Early Western World, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

How it is regarded as a center of painting has changed over the years. Some painting that was originally considered early Jammu is currently described as Basohli. Painting in Jammu in the mid-18th century is associated with Nainsukh, an important Pahari painter. The 'Bahu Shangri Ramayana' (ca. 1710) is one of the major painting series produced in the Pahari hills. This illustrated epic is characterized by vivid color, flamboyant design, and inventive composition. This style was short-lived, however, as more naturalistic styles were taking hold throughout the Pahari hills. With the establishment of the powerful Dogra dynasty under Gulab Singh in the mid-19th century, Jammu became a noteworthy center of painting, attracting many outside artists. Painters from Guler, Kangra, and the Punjab plains also worked for the Dogra rulers in older painting styles.

Other innovations include their very centralized form of authority with life tenure for the head of the order; gradation of members; a probationary period of many years before final vows; and lack of a female branch. Jesuits carry out many kinds of missionary work with special emphasis on education; the order has founded many colleges and universities throughout the world.

Shinran believed that since Amida's grace is relevant to a good person, it was even more so to a sinner. Reliance on Amida is all that is needed for liberation. Only one sincere recitation of the 'nembutsu' is needed to be reborn in Amida's Pure Land. The nembutsu is seen as an act of gratitude rather than one of supplicating trust. This and other aspects of Jodo Shinshu (e.g. it is a lay movement with no monks or monasteries) made it extremely popular. The school split into two factions in the 17th century, the Ōtani and Honganji.

Esoteric Tantric teachings are combined with the monastic discipline of the Kadampas. The more severe practices of Hatha Yoga are emphasized. A more positive ontology of the ultimate status of things is characteristic of Kagyü scholarship, in contrast to the thinking of the Geluks, who regard all phenomena as devoid of inherent existence. Milarepa, considered a great Tibetan poet, was Marpa's chief disciple. Gampopa was, in turn, Milarepa's most important student, and he was responsible for the organization of the Kagyü into a true school. Six separate schools of Kagyü thought (although similar in doctrine) quickly developed, including the Tshal, Baram, Karma, and Druk. Of these, the Druk went on to become the main school of Buddhism in Bhutan and the Karma was the main rival of the now-predominant Geluk school from the 15th to the early 17th century.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300019012>	Kangra		"Refers to a regional school of Pahari miniature painting that flourished in the hill state of Kangra. This prolific school flourished from about 1770 to almost the end of the 19th century, with the finest work painted around 1775-1820. Paintings as early as 1690 are known, however, and regional painting traditions continued into the twentieth century. The work produced in Kangra is greatly varied and so it is difficult to discuss a general Kangra style.  However, the influence of late Mughal art is evident in Kangra painting and it is often considered as a rejection of the Basohli school. Landscape and perspective are more naturalistic, colors are more subdued, line is more delicate and curvilinear, and the overall style is more lyrical than Basohli painting. Kangra painting reached its zenith during the reign of Raja Sansar Chand (reigned 1775-1823), an important patron. The school was not limited to the Kangra state but spread throughout the Himalayan foothill area, where many distinctive idioms developed. It is difficult to assign a definitive provenance to most of the painting since the hill states were small and often close to one another.  Scenes of Krishna from the poetical works, the 'Bhagavata-Purana' and the 'Gitagovinda,' are the most common subject matter of Kangra painting, along with illustrations of other Hindu myths, ragamala series, and portraits of hill chiefs and their families."@en	Pahari, Rajput, Indian painting styles, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

The best known Kirman carpets include a wide variety of 16th- and 17th-century vase carpets, rugs with rows of shrubs, arabesque carpets, fine garden carpets, and a group of medallion carpets with animals. All have asymmetrical knotting on cotton warps, with stiff, heavy woollen wefts pulled straight, and silk or cotton wefts between left relatively slack. The result is a double-warped carpet, the warps of one level lying almost directly behind adjacent warps. The color schemes of older carpets are among the richest and most varied found in Persian carpets. Vase carpets apparently continued to be made in the 18th century; a revival of carpet weaving came about in the late 19th century, with a variety of successive styles and fashions, including copies of French carpet styles, French paintings, architectural scenes with mosques and minarets, and symbolic and personage rugs similar to those made at Kashan and Tabriz.

Like other Rajput painting styles, it is somewhat indebted to contemporary Mughal painting. It is distinguished by its religious intensity and individualistic facial type consisting of pointed chins and noses, deeply curved eyes, and serpentine hair locks. Panoramic landscapes are often the background for the illustrated scene. An important patron during its formative phase was Raja Savant Singh (reigned 1748-57), who was himself a poet and devout member of the Vallabhacarya sect. The series of paintings of Radha and Krishna are particularly noteworthy. It is speculated that Savant Singh's lover may have been the model for the Kishangarh facial type. Nihal Chand is the master artist credited with transmitting his patron's romantic and religious into fresh visual images.

The Khitan were a nomadic people that had little artistic tradition of its own. The artwork produced in this period was influenced by Tang forms and techniques. Liao architecture displays Tang influence and an adherence to Buddhism. Extant buildings include the Bai ta (White Pagoda) at Balin in Inner Mongolia, the Mu ta (Timber Pagoda) in Ying xian in Shanxi province, the oldest surviving timber pagoda, and the library for the Bhagavad sūtras (ca. 1038) of Huayan Lower Temple, Datong, also in Shanxi province. The last structure also contains 32 original Liao statues and wooden scripture cabinets in pavilion form. Liao ceramics were likewise influenced by those of the Tang period, although tomb excavations show that Song and other wares were imported as well. Gold and silver objects were also made using Tang and Song metalworking and gilding techniques. The Khitan were defeated by the invading Jin who went on to overthrow the Northern Song.

From the 10th to the early 13th century, the period reveals more aggressive Khmer influences and is characterized by the Prasat Wat Prang (tenth century) and Prasat Ban Chang, both featuring brick towers with sandstone doorframes on a north-south axis, pilasters, and trilobed lamp niches, and by the Prasat Phra and Prasat Phanom Wan, both featuring vestibules and mondops housing relics or Buddha images. From the late 13th to 14th century, the architecture developed regional artistic elements but retained traditional Khmer iconography. Temples in this latter style feature laterite construction, extensive sanctuaries dedicated to Buddha and bodhisattvas, the prang, a distinctively Thai structure characterized by the upward elongation of the bullet shape of the classical Khmer tower sanctuary, and further variations on the mondop and  square tower with redans.

The doctrine is based on the Augsburg Confession, the Apology, Luther's two Catechisms, and the Formula of Concord. Lutheran churches first flourished in Scandinavia and Germany, later spreading to other parts of Europe. Lutheranism spread to the United States after the 1740s through immigration and spread to Africa and Asia through Lutheran missionary work in the 19th century.

A prime architectural example from this period is the Lotus Temple (1049 CE) in Hanoi, featuring decorative motifs in terracotta along the roof ridges, a distinct lotus-shaped construction, and a complex truss system consisting of intersecting beams and columns. In sculpture, the period features Buddha figures seated on platforms with dragon and flower decorations, relief panels reflecting Cham or Chinese art styles, stupas with sculpted motifs of oak and vine leaves, and statues of lions, elephants, buffaloes, and horses each on a lotus pedestal and carved from a single block of stone."@en	Vietnamese periods, Vietnamese (culture or style), Southeast Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

While the style is often considered archaistic, it was nevertheless a well-established tradition.

Mamluk architecture was basically conservative and not particularly innovative but it is prolific and generally of very high quality. Mamluk architecture is distinguished by the use of incredibly elaborate minarets, huge facades and portals, and the tendency to build structures with different uses in a single complex. Patrons also typically built their major monuments close to one another. The Mamluks are also known for their technical virtuosity in stone construction; masons often alternated different colored stones on the surfaces of buildings. Almost 3000 major Mamluk monuments have been preserved or are known through texts; most monuments in the old quarters of Cairo, Damascus, Tripoli, and Aleppo are Mamluk and most on the Haram ash-Sharif in Jerusalem, outside the Dome of the Rock, are Mamluk as well. Like architecture, the other arts of the Mamluk period achieved a high level of technical perfection but are not known for their originality; there are noteworthy examples of inlaid metalwork, calligraphy, mosque lamps, and wooden objects.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300264477>	Mandaeanism	Mandean; Mandeans; Mandaeans; Subbas; Christians of St John; Christians of Saint John; Christians of St. John	"Refers to an ancient Middle Eastern religion still surviving in Iraq and Khuzistan (southwest Iran). The religion is usually considered a Gnostic sect and as such is the only surviving representative of Gnosticism. Mandaeans number about 15,000-20,000. Mandaeanism, like other dualistic systems, emphasizes salvation of the soul through esoteric knowledge (gnosis). The spiritual soul will be freed from the material world by their redeemer, Manda d'Hayye, but evil Archons obstruct the ascent of the soul. In Mandaeanism, Jesus is seen as a false messiah but John the Baptist is revered for performing miraculous healings through baptism. Mandaeans developed elaborate cultic ritual, particularly for baptism, which is not a part of any other known Gnostic sect. Baptism is seen as purification from sin and it can be often repeated. The religion's origins are obscure and remain controversial. On the basis of Babylonian elements in Mandaean magical texts, the use of the Iranian calendar, and the incorporation of several Iranian words into the Mandaic language, some scholars argue that Mandaeanism originated in southwestern Mesopotamia in pre-Christian or early Christian times. Other scholars argue for a Syro-Palestinian origin on the basis of the 'Haran Gawaita,' a quasi-historical Mandaean document narrating the exodus from Palestine to Mesopotamia of the Nasoreans (the Mandaean priestly caste as opposed to Mandaiia, the laity) in the 1st century CE. Certain noteworthy affinities to Judaism are also called attention to: a familiarity with the Old Testament; parallels to Jewish ethics, especially the high value placed on marriage and procreation; the use of Hebrew angelology; and a concern for cultic purity. There are also a number of similarities to Manichaeism. The Mandaeans may be the Sabeans mentioned in the Koran. Mandaean literature, written in an Aramaic dialect and in a distinctive script, is quite extensive. Important extant works include the Ginza (Book of Adam); the Book of John; the Book of the Zodiac; and the Baptism of Hibil Ziwa.

While earlier painting was influenced by the Mughals, Mandi painting became distinctive under Raja Sidh Sen (reigned 1684-1727), who was personally influential over the new style. Mandi painting of this period is often characterized by bold, sweeping lines, a muted palette, and simple compositions consisting of three horizontal registers. The vital and bold sculpture of the time is considered to be an important influence on the rendering of figures in painting. Strong facial features, oversize heads and hands, and generally statuesque figures are typical. Shiva is a popular subject since Sidh Sen was a devotee of the god. Shiva, Devi and Tantric themes were more popular than the literary themes seen in a great deal of other Pahari painting. A later phase of Mandi painting started around 1805 and is associated with the artist Sajnu from Guler. Works painted by him for Raja Ishwari Sen are characterized by curved and heavily ornamented borders, crowded and detailed compositions, and buildings and figures placed at angles."@en	Pahari, Rajput, Indian painting styles, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

The religious movement is generally considered a type of Gnosticism, a system based on the attainment of salvation through knowledge of spiritual truth. It advocates self-knowledge and inner illumination as a defense against succumbing to the evil world of matter and as a path to salvation. Highly dualistic in philosophy, this movement is characterized by the belief in the antithetical substances of Light and Dark, Spirit and Matter, and Good and Evil. The religious community is divided into the elect, who embrace the rigorous, ascetic lifestyle, and into the hearers, who support the elect through works.

It is one of the largest Eastern-rite communities of the Roman Catholic Church, being particularly popular in modern Lebanon, and it is the only Eastern-rite church that has no non-Catholic or Orthodox counterpart. In 680 the Maronites were condemned for their supposed Monothelite beliefs: accepting the heretical doctrine of Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople, who stated that Christ had divine but no human will. The Maronites, however, assert that they have always been orthodox Christians. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was begun in 1182 and was further solidified in the 16th century with aid from the Jesuit community. After the pope, the spiritual head of the Maronites is the \"patriarch of Antioch and all the East,\" residing in Bkirki, near Beirut. Over the centuries and under various ruling bodies, the Maronites have managed to preserve their freedom, religion, and folk customs. The church retains the ancient West Syrian liturgy, even though Arabic is the vernacular language of the Maronites. Fearful of persecution, Maronites in the 19th century emigrated to southern Europe and North and South America where they can still be found today.

Buddhist Mathura sculpture includes Buddha portraits based on yaksha (male earth-spirit) models, as well as some of the earliest examples of entirely Indian Buddha figures. The many vivacious and frankly sexual yakshi figures (female earth-spirits) are also well-known examples of Mathuran sculpture. One of the most notable achievements of the period was the assimilation of the Mauryan-style standing colossus to Buddhist purposes. Characteristics of Mathura sculpture include monumental frontality; the rendering of gathered, transparent drapery as small ringed folds; and later Buddha figures with large haloes decorated with foliated scroll-work. Deep relief is common in the 2nd century while a more smooth and linear style is found in the 5th century. Much Mathura sculpture is carved out of local Sikri sandstone, which is pink or mottled red with cream spots. Mathuran icons were imported to other areas of India and they were also copied by other workshops. Although the Kushan dynasty declined in the 3rd century, the Kushan style of art at Mathura survived and later led to the further development of the Buddha icon in the Gupta period."@en	Kushan, <Indian dynastic styles and periods>, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300018877>	Maurya	Ashoka; Asoka	"Refers to the sculpture and stone-cut architecture created under the Mauryan emperors, and more specifically to art created during the forty-year reign of Ashoka, the third Maurya emperor (died 232 BCE), who ruled over all of India. Earlier sculpture had generally been made of wood but during the Maurya period stone became the preferred medium. Polished monolithic edict pillars with intricately carved capitals were erected throughout India. The capitals, made of a tan sandstone called Chunar, are the best remaining examples of Mauryan imperial art; their unique surface gloss is known as the 'Mauryan polish.' The subjects of the capitals often represent aspects of Buddhism in symbolic terms as well as Ashoka's position as an enlightened world-ruler. The style of carving is strongly influenced by Persian or, more specifically, Achaemenid sculpture. The practice of erecting monumental columns may be indigenous to India; recent evidence suggests that the Ashokan edict columns come out of ancient tradition of a cult of the cosmic pillar, or 'Axis Mundi.' Only a few Mauryan figural sculptures have survived: the earliest known two sculptures of Jain Tirthankaras as well yakshi and yaksha figures (female and male earth-spirits). They are noted for their monumentality and voluptuousness. The oldest surviving Indian architecture is from the Maurya period: these rock-cut chambers built by Ashoka for monks were the beginning of a long Indian tradition that came to be important to all of India's religious communities."@en	<Indian dynastic styles and periods>, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Mewar's artistic traditionalism generally stood up to Mughal, Deccani, and European influences due to the conservatism of this particular Rajput court as well as to the traditional artist family structure. Artists consistently included Mewar-specific details such as local architecture and flora and fauna. The indigenous tradition of mythological and poetical manuscript illustration underwent a renaissance here in the 17th century.

These tablets were inscribed with the Book of Mormon, which Smith translated. The Book of Mormon is an account of certain tribes of Israel that migrated to America before the birth of Christ; it also tells of a post-resurrection appearance of Christ in America. The authenticity of the texts has been questioned for a number of reasons, but it is not disputed by Mormons. Mormon doctrine is also derived from the King James Version of the Bible although Mormonism is very divergent from Christian doctrine. Perhaps most notably, Mormonism holds that the Trinity is three distinct beings. Mormons believe that Christian churches have apostasized but true Christianity has been restored by Smith. Mormonism contends that spiritual perfection or godhood can be attained through a process of spiritual evolution and daily practical guidance. Entry to Christ's kingdom is attained through repentance and baptism by immersion. Mormons believe in the coming of a millennium when Christ will rule from Jerusalem and Independence, Missouri. Mormonism is often associated with ideas such as collective ownership, tithing, polygamy (later abandoned), strong conformity, heavy church activism, and proselytization."@en	Christianity, religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet

It is also known for its sumptuousness and classical aspects, the latter due to the fact that this area was the home of the classicizing Reims Style in the Carolingian period.

Other artists who practiced the style were Charles Angrand, Louis Hayet, Henri Edmond Cross, Léo Gausson, Hippolyte Petitjean, Albert Dubois, and Maximilien Luce. Seurat is considered the outstanding artist of the movement. Neo-Impressionism both developed out of Impressionism and was a reaction against it. Like Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism was concerned with light and color but while the former was typically spontaneous and empirical, the later was based more on scientific principles and resulted in formalized compositions. The associated technique is referred to as pointillism and the associated theory is referred to as divisionism, although the two terms are often used interchangably and are also both used to refer to the style and movement.

This sculpture illustrates the productivity of the period as well as the fast evolution of style that occurred since the Northern Wei. Some massive, sculptural ceramic forms date from the Northern Qi. Two or more colored glazes were applied to Northern Qi ceramics and white-bodied wares were developed. The wall paintings in the tomb of the aristocrat Lou Rui at Taiyuan are examples of the high-quality painting produced during this time. The rule of Gao Yang was followed by the rule of tyrants who conscripted almost two million men to build the Great Wall.

During the Northern Song period there was a new interest in antiquity and the beginnings of Chinese archaeology. Printing became more widespread and with it the publication of reference works. Imperial patronage was very noteworthy and influential at this time. For instance, the emperor Taizong (reigned 976-997) had an impressive painting and calligraphy collection and Huizong (reigned 1101-1125) commissioned catalogues of his own enormous collection. Huizong also established a school of painting as a branch of the Hanlin Painting Academy. Landscapes became more important with such notable artists as Fan Kuan, Juran, Guo Xi, Dong Yuan, and Li Cheng. The distinction between court painting and that of the Daoist literati became more pronounced. Northern Song ceramics are characterized by simple shapes, pure color, refined decoration, and technical perfection. Ding, Ru, Jun, and northern celadons made at Linru and Yaozhou were Northern Song wares patronized by the court. Sculpture became less symbolic and figures became more lifelike. Expensive defense and imperial extravagance led to a weakened dynasty; after incursions by the Jin, Huizong's successor moved south of the Huai River to establish the Southern Song dynasty."@en	Song (Chinese style), Chinese dynastic styles and periods, Chinese (culture or style), East Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Artistic production in this style primarily deals with the wood carving arts and features teak figures of Brahmanical and Hindu gods and of Buddhist images. Sculptures and carvings were often inlaid with mother-of-pearl or glass mosaics. The style is driven by the desire to intermingle animal, plant, and human life, evincing a detailed, exuberant blend of myth and realism. From this distinctive art, stylistic contradictions emerged, evidenced by sculptural figures of menacing demon entities doubling as guardian beings and by rigid geometric patterns set amidst designs of fanciful creatures on wooden relief panels. The most dramatic example in this style are the grandiose wooden royal barges and royal funeral chariots, both completely gilded constructions with mythical serpents and ornamental floral designs."@en	Thai styles, Thai (culture or style), Southeast Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Buddhist art flourished under state and private patronage during most of this period. Cave temples at Yungang were begun in ca. 460; thousands of craftsmen worked for about 35 years to make the temples and adorn them with sculpture and painting. Other cave temples were later made at Longmen at the instigation of Xiaowendi. While Yungang features static icons in a Gandharan style, the sculpture at Longmen is more linear, demonstrating the emerging Chinese style. Northern Wei burial pottery, also influenced by Buddhism, emphasizes frontality and symmetry. The nomadic Touba people began to rely on Chinese institutions to organize and run their state and they also became accustomed to Chinese culture and luxuries; under Xiaowendi Chinese became the official language and the use of Tuoba language was forbidden. The distinction between the 'barbarian' north and 'civilized' south became less marked; nevertheless, northern frontiersmen began to feel neglected and so they revolted, leading to the collapse of the Northern Wei dynasty.

The Yuwen family of the Xianbei tribe created the Northern Zhou dynasty out of the puppet state of Western Wei. The dynasty was based in the Wei River valley and had its capital at Chang'an in Shaanxi province. Buddhists were persecuted during the reign of Emperor Wudi (reigned 561-577) because the monasteries were considered a drain on the state. Wudi's conquer of the Northern Qi dynasty, which temporarily reunited northern China, was largely financed by the confiscation of monastery property and supported by the forced labor of the million monks and nuns forcibly laicized. Nevertheless, Buddhist art was still created during this period, most notably at Chang'an. Indian Gupta sculptures were the models for several massive Buddha sculptures and there are a few Northern Zhou style wall paintings in the Thousand Buddha Caves in Dunhuang. In such paintings the landscape is important yet subordinate to figural elements.

Under the support of Ottoman sultans, a distinct architectural style developed that combined the Islamic traditions of Anatolia, Iran, and Syria with those of the Classical world and Byzantium. The result was a rationalist approach that favored spatial unity and clarity, the most important structure being the kulliye, a building complex combining religious, educational and charitable buildings. The main architectural theme of this complex was the domed square unit and combinations of varying spatial and architectonic expressions. The mosque, and in some cases the mosque-convent, was the crowning achievement. Under the conquest of Constantinople and the establishment of new administrative palaces across the empire, the relationship between Ottoman patrons and the artist became centralized. A corps of court architects employed architects of different ranks, and controlled all building activity throughout the empire. A community of craftsman brought together societies of artists and craftsman, forming the imperial design studio where illuminated manuscripts, tiles, woodwork, carved stone, jade, and metal objects, along with carpets and textiles were produced. These works typically chronicled the important events of a sultan's rule. During the 18th and 19th century, Ottoman art was increasingly westernized in style, often incorporating elements of European Baroque style."@en	<Anatolian Islamic styles and periods after Manzikert>, <Islamic World dynastic styles and periods>, Islamic World, The, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

This one is geographically based in the Himalayan foothills, stretching from Jammu to Garhwal. The area it covered was smaller than that of Rajasthan so it is more likely that artists traveled in search of work. While two main schools, Basohli and Kangra, are often identified by scholars, there are numerous other regional idioms. In many cases, a classification based upon ateliers and families may be more appropriate since regional schools are difficult to distinguish. The sack of Dehli in 1739 and subsequent collapse of Mughal power forced artists to seek patronage elsewhere; these artists brought about the further refinement of Pahari painting, particularly in regards to realism. Pahari painting is considered the last vital Hindu art form before the neutralizing effect of the West was felt in the nineteenth century. Pahari painting, like some other Rajput painting, shows a  preference for depicting the legends of the cowherd god Krishna."@en	Rajput, Indian painting styles, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

While Paulicians honored the gospel according to St. Luke and the letters of St. Paul, they rejected the Old Testament, the letters of St. Peter, and the sacraments, worship, and hierarchy of the established church.

Pentecostal churches are characterized by their various forms of participatory and informal worship and by their literal interpretation of the Bible. The movement probably appeals to the poor and less-educated in part because there is a general emphasis on spiritual experience rather than intellectual reflection. Missionary work is typically a high priority but the formation of a representative body of Pentecostals is usually opposed just as is the ecumenical movement.

Generally speaking, it advocated a pluralistic approach to the arts and it stated that Modernism had failed because of a lack of a coded language of meaning to the viewer. The term was first used by Spanish poet Federico de Onis in 1934 and later by Arnold Toynbee's \"A Study of History\" in 1938, but it was in the 1970s when it came into wide use in connection with a trend in architecture that employed selective Eclecticism and Historicism. This resulted in structures that displayed a knowledge of Modernism, but also playful, whimsical, applications of Classical elements. In the other arts, such as painting, there was a return to a classical approach to the human figure, style, and composition, often resulting in Old Masters style works, but with updated imagery, such as the inclusion of current celebrities, or artists from the past. In photography, as well as painting, a narrative or story telling approach to work also became popular. By the early 1980s, many work dubbed Postmodern, were purchased by the corporate art market, where large sums were paid for the work of relatively new artists. By the 1990s, Postmodernism showed signs of slowing down in terms of popularity, when more traditional Modernist forms began to re-emerge."@en	<international post-1945 styles and movements>, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

This one is geographically based in the Central Plains region. The evolution of Rajasthani painting out of early Western Indian painting is not completely understood. It seems to have begun in the 16th century, and in its first phase retained a hieratic and abstract quality. The subject matter is essentially Hindu, with particular attention to the life of Krishna. The literature and painting of the time were products of the contemporary religious development that emphasized devotion to Krishna as the way to salvation. Popular themes were pictorial representations of the musical modes (ragamala) and of love poetry. The style was not much influenced by Mughal painting styles until the eighteenth century when the sharp distinction between the two styles became more obscured.

Their courts were often Hindu centers of learning and they were patrons of poets, scholars and artists. Rajput painting was a huge movement with markedly Indian characteristics, in a sense contrasting with the art of the Muslim Mughals who were their opponents. Nevertheless, as the Rajput rulers came to be obedient to the Mughal rulers in order to keep their territories, Mughal artistic developments affected traditional manuscript illumination of the Rajput courts in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The Mughals were particularly important to the introduction and spread of portrait painting in Rajput artistic centers. In contrast to Mughal painting which was realistic, Rajput painting is, like the Hindi literature it is closely tied to, symbolic and suffused with poetic metaphor. Even the colors used often had specific meaning; the coloration is typically flat and unblended in a manner suggesting stained glass. The known examples from the late sixteenth to the nineteenth century fall into two main groups, Rajasthani and Pahari."@en	Indian painting styles, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

The pottery found at Samarra, however, probably came from nearby Baghdad and examples of this style have been found in Persia, Spain, Egypt and Syria, all places the style later spread to. It is characterized by thin bodies made of very finely levigated sulphur-yellow clay and by carefully applied soft tin glazes. A noteworthy technical achievement of Samarra ware is the brilliant gold luster deliberately combined with other metallic tones on both tiles and vessels. Decoration usually consists of single animals or larger designs on the inside of vessels with rings of dashes almost always decorating the exterior. Early examples from the 8th century successfully mimic gold dishes, suggesting that they were the earliest substitutes for forbidden table wares of precious metal.

The Shang ruled from ca. 1600 BCE to ca. 1050 BCE and their culture was centered on the Yellow River plain although their power extended at times over modern northern Henan province and parts of modern Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces. This period is notable for its advances in bronzeworking and other technologies, all of which led to a higher level of civilization. The Shang had large armies with a wide variety of weapons and armor. Bronze was also used for ritual objects such as bells and stands. Decoration on Shang bronzes was highly schematic with the 'taotie' animal mask a preferred motif. Shang religion and ancestor worship featured the use of so-called oracle bones (jiagu), inscribed animal bones and tortoise shells. Nearly 100,000 oracle bones have been uncovered since scholars recognized their significance. Oracle bones are the oldest form of Chinese historiography, establishing a list of kings in agreement with later written histories. The Shang writing system was quite sophisticated; some Shang characters are still in use today. Shang pottery came in a variety of colors and was wheelmade or coiled, often featuring impressed patterns. The earliest known Chinese glazes were made in the Shang period. Marble and limestone sculptures of both real and mythical creatures have been found. Shang urban settlements have shown that the basic forms of Chinese architecture already existed; noteworthy settlements include those at Erlitou, Zhengzhou, and Yin (at modern Anyang), all of which served as the capital at different times. The late Shang rulers were hedonistic builders of luxurious palaces.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300106504>	Shanghai school		"Refers to a group of painters working primarily in Shanghai from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century. Although not a school in the Western sense, the painters associated with it shared subject-matter, styles, techniques, and the patronage of Shanghai merchants. After the devastating Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864), four professional painters surnamed Ren moved to Shanghai: Ren Xiong (1820-1857), his brother Ren Xun (1835-1893) and his son Ren Yu (1853-1901) from Xiaoshan and the unrelated Ren Yi (1840-1896) from Hangzhou, both in Zhejiang province. The four Rens, of whom Ren Yi was the most influential and successful, formed the nucleus of the emerging school. Shanghai school painting was made to please its merchant patrons. The paintings, typically displayed in the merchants' offices and homes, were mostly decorative, and their subjects often contain auspicious symbolism pertaining to longevity, good fortune, or prosperity. The hanging scroll format was particularly popular, as was the folding fan format. The works typically feature bold coloration and accessible and everyday subject-matter such as figures, birds, and plants. Landscape usually had a minor role in Shanghai painting. Shanghai flower painting was popularized by Zhao Zhiqian (1829-1884), who is known for his large, decorative scrolls of flowers painted in broad brushstrokes of rich, opaque color. The Shanghai school attained its height in the early 20th century under Wu Changshi, arguably the best of the Shanghai artists."@en	Chinese painting styles, Chinese (culture or style), East Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

During this time, rival clans tried to control portions of the Han empire. Chinese art was influenced during this time by new ideas, especially religious developments. Buddhism, which came to China from neighboring India, had the most profound effect on Six Dynasties art; by the fourth century there was an established category of Chinese Buddhist art. The monastery at Dunhuang in western China preserves notable wall paintings. Monumental sculpture, a tradition brought to China from northern India, became popular, as is evidenced in the massive stone carvings of Buddhist deities in the mountains of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Wooden pagodas, based on both the stupa of India and the towers of the Han dynasty, were an important architectural development of the period. The native belief systems of Confucianism and Taoism also fostered new subject matter and styles. The Confucian ideal was most popularly expressed in scenes of filial piety while Taoist artists favored landscapes and folk legends. Secular artistic traditions also underwent changes, particularly in the realm of painting. Gu Kaizhi, considered the father of Chinese landscape painting, was active during this period. Noteworthy advances in ceramics in southern China were also made, most notably in the green-glazed stoneware called Yueh-yao or \"Yueh ware,\" a durable ceramic that was eventually exported to places as distant as Egypt and the Philippines. It was during this period that gentlemen-painters and calligraphers and great private art collections first emerged in China. Literary and art criticism also developed.

It was a time of social, economic, and artistic invention and transition; in particular, an unsurpassed refinement was achieved in many of the arts. As society shifted away from being one of aristocrats towards one of meritorious commoners, the ruling class sought to shore up their power. For instance, emperors promoted the painting of themes associated with dynastic legitimacy and stability. The Song emperors were among China's most culturally enlightened rulers and many were even accomplished artists in their own right. Since the Song emperors were less powerful than their Han and Tang predecessors and because they maintained a tenuous peace with their hostile neighbors, the art of this period is introspective. The Song period is best known for landscape painting, although ceramics, sculpture, and architecture also flourished. Clay and wood often replaced stone for sculpture, allowing for softer, more lifelike figures. Song architecture is notably elongated and thin with curved roofs and a distinctive Song spire. Pagodas were first constructed of masonry during this period. There are two divisions within this style and period: Northern Sung, dating to 960 to 1127, and Southern Sung, dating to 1127 to 1279."@en	Chinese dynastic styles and periods, Chinese (culture or style), East Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Dogen also wrote the 'General Teaching for Seated Meditation' which describes the five stages of zazen, culminating in the realization of the individual's oneness with reality.

The dynasty was established by Gaozong (reigned 1127-1162), son of the last emperor of the Northern Song. The dynasty had its capital at Nanjing and later at Lin'an and it ruled the area south of the Huai River. Foreign influence was avoided and archaic traditions were often drawn on. Landscape remained the most important genre of painting with artists such as Ma Yuan and Xia Gui depicting local, ethereal, gentle scenery in contrast to the craggy landscapes of Northern Song painters. This school of painting, called the Ma-Xia school, came out of the emperor's painting academy. In sharp contrast are the active and spontaneous brush paintings of Zen monks of the period. Since northern kilns were now unavailable, new southern centers of ceramic production began to be patronized by the court. Special guan (official) wares were made near the palace. Celadon-glazed stoneware in explicitly archaic forms was made at Longquan. A small factory producing Qingbai wares at Jingdezhen expanded during the period, eventually becoming the greatest center for ceramics in China. Jades and metalwork were often made in archaistic forms. The manufacture of the fine silk tapestry known as 'kesi' reached its pinnacle in the Southern Song. Gilded and painted wooden Buddhist sculptures featured sensuous bodies, enigmatic smiles, and a sense of vitality.

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300018419>	Sui		"Refers to a Chinese dynasty of the period 589 to 618 CE. During this time northern and southern China were reunited after centuries of separation. Although a relatively brief dynastic period, it was a time of noteworthy economic, political, and educational innovation. A prosperous trade with Central Asia and the West developed during this period. Innovation also occured in the fields of engineering and architecture, as seen in the works of the engineer Li Chun and the architect Kai Yuwen, who both worked under the emperor Wendi (reigned 581-604). Li Chun was responsible for the world's oldest open-spandrel stone arch bridge, the Anji bridge, and Kai Yuwen laid out the city of Daxing, which became the world's largest and most populous city of its day. The Sui were ardent Buddhists and much of their stone sculpture, unlike their bronze, wood, and lacquer work, survives; they also repaired many older Buddhist images. Sui sculpture is considered technically fine but lacking in some of the elegance found in the best Northern Qi sculpture. Sui ceramics are well modelled and relatively plain. Sui celadons, some decorated with stamped patterns, have been unearthed in both northern and southern China. Many stoneware and earthenware figurines of warriors, officials, and guardian creatures were created, especially for use as funerary objects. Earthenware models of such everyday objects as stoves and shoes were included in tombs for use in the afterlife. Costly military failures, natural disasters, and an autocratic and extravagant rule led to the decline of the Sui dynasty, which was succeeded by the Tang dynasty."@en	Chinese dynastic styles and periods, Chinese (culture or style), East Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

The period is considered the golden age of Thai civilization, dramatically influencing all other subsequent periods. In sculpture, the period is driven by religious orthodoxy, featuring refined Buddhist and Hindu images in bronze and stucco. A prevalent iconographic theme in sculpture was the Buddha's Footprint, often carved into stucco or stone, decorated with Wheel of the Law inscriptions and figures of deities and Buddhas, and found in wat temples throughout the region. Buddha images in this style predominantly feature a flame-like halo, hair set in small, pointed curls, and a hooked nose and mouth. Sukhothai sculptors were the first to portray Buddha in all four physical manifestations: sitting, reclining, standing, and walking. Productions in bas-relief recount dramatic religious events and are usually constructed in stucco. Architecture of this period features brick and laterite constructions, timber roofs covered with glazed terracotta tiles, the unique lotus bud-shaped stupas, conventional structures such as the prang, mondop, and wihan, stone pillars with carved capitals, niches housing Buddha sculptures, Khmer-style towers and makara sculptures in the pediments of niches, and a stylistic tendency toward attenuation and sleekness in architectural construction."@en	Thai periods, Thai (culture or style), Southeast Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

<http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300018880>	Sunga	Shunga (Indian style)	"Refers to the culture created during the Sunga dynasty of the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE in India. The Sungas overthrew the Maurya empire in 185 BCE. The Sunga empire was not as extensive as that of the Mauryas, so while works of art created during this time may be said to belong to the Sunga period, this term does not always imply patronage or Sunga control over a certain area. With the Sunga period began an unbroken continuum of Indian art and architecture. The earliest surviving stupa railing, along with part of a gateway, was found in Bharhut in eastern Madhya Pradesh and dates from this period. As was the case with other early stupa railings, figures and reliefs were donated by individuals whose names were inscribed. Labels often identify the scenes depicted since Buddhist iconography was still in its infancy. Overall, emphasis in Sunga art was placed on the communication of a religious message at the expense of naturalism; this becomes a dominant feature of later Indian art as well. Carved yakshi and yaksha figures and other pre-Buddhist dieties that were incorporated into the fold of Buddhism are commonly found. An important difference between these figures and earlier ones is that many have a more relaxed left leg. The figures are still stiff and heavy like Maurya figures, but the thick garments and high polish are gone. Other important sites include the rock-cut caves in the western Ghats, particularly those of Bhaja and Pitalkhora. These Buddhist cave settlements consisted of a caitya hall and living quarters for the monks (viharas). The facades were usually decorated with horseshoe-shaped arches while the interior sculptural decoration was generally simple; painting and wooden additions were probably once part of the iconographic and decorative schemes."@en	<Indian dynastic styles and periods>, Indian (South Asian), South Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

Suleyman's reign is seen as the height of Ottoman political, economic, and cultural development, and the artistic institutions and systems of patronage established during his reign set the standard that Suleyman's two successors, Selim II and Murad III. Under Suleyman, two major art institutions underwent significant change. The office of chief architect was held for most of his reign by Sinan, who oversaw the construction of a vast number of religious, educational, and economic buildings. Sinan restructured the unadorned external elevation of the Ottoman mosque with a battery of articulating devices such as single or double entrance porticoes, interlocking volumes of domes and semi-domes, and a new type of slender, pencil-like minaret of great height. This style is best exemplified in Sinan's Selimiye mosque at Edirne, 1569-1575.  Also under Sulyeman, two branches of the royal design studio brought about the basic synthesis of the new Ottoman imperial style in decoration and book illustration. Iznik tiles of this period are considered to be unparalleled in their depth of tone and richness of color, with the introduction of bold reds, purples, blues, and olive greens.

Essential features of T'ien T'ia include the concept of the threefold truth of empty, temporary, and middle, implying that all things are both distinct and part of a whole at the same time. An extension of this concept is the T'ien T'ia belief that all beings, though distinct, share the same Buddha nature and are therefore able to reach Buddhahood eventually. While T'ien T'ia acknowledges all other schools of Buddhism, it sees Buddhism as divided in 5 periods culminating in the 'Lotus Sutra' as the crown of the religion.

China flourished as a stable, consolidated empire and the resulting prosperity and patronage created a Golden Age of Chinese painting, metalwork, ceramics, music, and poetry. Chang'an, with its masterful urban planning, remained the main Tang capital and a world center. Taizong (reigned 626-649) and Xuanzong (reigned 712-756) were important Tang rulers and patrons. Buddhism remained influential although it suffered periods of persecution during the Tang dynasty. Paintings from the caves at Dunhuang and stone pagodas such as the Great Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 652) and the Small Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 707) in Chang'an have survived. Monumental stone sculpture of the northern provinces displays the new tendency toward fuller, more sensual figures. This tendency also found in secular Tang sculpture, both stone and ceramic. The merging of Indian and Chinese sculpture styles is seen at the cave at Mt. Tianlong, created under the patronage of Empress Wu Zetian (reigned 690-705). Painting, which flourished during the Tang, was dominated by the secular landscape tradition. Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao, father and son, and Wang Wei are three painters' names known to us; probable copies of their work exist. Wang Wei's work, influential for later artists, was intimate and melancholy while the work of Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao features the bright greens and blues of many Tang landscapes. Chinese portrait painting, begun in the Han dynasty, was refined in the Tang by such artists as Wu Daozi. Tang ceramics include sancai earthenware figurines and vessels, typically used as tomb objects, white porcellanous wares such as the well-known Xing ware of Henan province, and the jadelike Yue celadons of Zhejiang province. The use of metal oxides in underglaze decoration was developed in Hunan and Sichuanh provinces and porcelain, although not fully exploited until later, has its origins in the Tang period. Tang decorative arts were influenced by Middle Eastern and other foreign trends during the Tang dynasty, leading to new styles in ceramics and metalwork. For instance, colorful glazed earthenware objects such as ewers and rhytons were made to resemble Persian silverwork and Persian weft patterning were introduced to Chinese textiles. China, in turn, exported its pottery, silk, and printing and paper technology.

Nevertheless, three separate elements are typically found in Umayyad art, often in the same work: the naturalism of Syria where the Hellenistic tradition was still strong; the more decorative Coptic style of Egypt; and the Sassanian style of Persia which combined Hellenistic elements with aspects of the earlier Achaemenid period.

In the 19th century Lavoix popularized the identification of these objects as Veneto-Saracenic but his theory that Muslim metalworkers worked in Venice and trained Italian craftsmen in the Islamic style was challenged in 1970, when Huth questioned whether guild laws would have allowed foreign craftsmen on Venetian territory.

Although a time of geographic division, China benefited from foreign influences and Wei institutions such as land reform, taxation, and militia systems were further developed by later Chinese dynasties. Buddhism was widely adopted during the Wei period and it quickly became the main inspiration for figurative art. The Wei rulers were great patrons of Buddhist art, commissioning vast rock-cut temples decorated with sculpture and painting at Yungang, Longmen, Mt. Maiji and Dunhuang.

Sima Yan deposed the last Wei ruler and defeated the state of Wu, thus briefly uniting China. The Western Jin period is noted for the high-fired, green-glazed stoneware that was to imitate bronzes. Such ceramics, as well as grave models and bronze mirrors, were found in Western Jin tombs. Fighting between powerful families prevented an effective government from forming and provoked civil war; drought and famine made the situation worse.

The dynasty was founded by the Mongol Kublai Khan (reigned 1260-1294), reuniting all of China into a empire that extended west as far as modern Poland and Hungary. While not great patrons of the arts, by reuniting China, expanding trade, and by not imposing stylistic demands, different traditions and influences were brought together and freely used. Innovations occurred particularly in the applied arts of porcelain and lacquer. During this time the Silk Route was reopened and Europe's interest in China began to develop. In response to foreign domination, educated Chinese withdrew into tradtions of their native past, with many scholars rejecting government service. The school of literati painting became dominant in the realm of painting, with artists emphasizing individual and calligraphic expression in contrast to the decorativeness of official painting. The most important Yuan masters were Huang Gongwang, Wu Zhen, Ni Zan, and Wang Meng, all of whom were literati objectors to Mongol rule. A noteworthy exception was Zhao Mengu, the most important Yüan calligrapher, who served the Mongols and was president of the Hanlin Academy. In the realm of ceramics, Middle Eastern influence stimulated exuberant blue-and-white decoration; Middle Eastern merchants also commissioned enormous Longquan celadons. Much Buddhist sculpture was commissioned during the Yüan period, with Tantric, multi-limbed figures revealing the Mongol preference for the lamaist art of Nepal and Tibet. The chiselling technique in silverwork, associated with the silversmith Zhu Bishan, developed at this time; Yüan carved lacquer was also produced. The Mongols made contributions to architecture, with the buildings of Beijing, the Mongol capital, built on a grand and massive scale; the city plan was adapted by the later Ming and Qing dynasties. The Yüan dynasty declined after the death of Kublai Khan."@en	Chinese dynastic styles and periods, Chinese (culture or style), East Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

The area ruled by the Zhous was very large but their rule was not direct and so was often challenged. The Zhou period is divided into the Western Zhou (ca. 1050-771 BCE) and the Eastern Zhou (771-256 BCE). There was a great deal of regional diversity in the Zhou period, but overall it was a time of noteworthy political, philosophical, religious, and social changes. Many basic Chinese traditions were established and the earliest Chinese literature dates from the Zhou period, including the writing of Confucius. The population increased at this time and iron tools became more widespread, leading to agricultural advances. The rise of a merchant class and the development of coinage created a bigger market for artistic wares, of which bronzes remained the most important, becoming more secular and serving as symbols of status, wealth, and authority. Longer inscriptions are found on Zhou bronzes and are now valuable records of early Chinese history. The decoration of bronzes became more abstract, geometric, and colorful with an increased use of relief and precious inlay. The many small states of the Zhou dynasty became virtually independent of central authority and it was the Qin who eventually defeated the other states to establish the first unified Chinese rule."@en	Chinese dynastic styles and periods, Chinese (culture or style), East Asian, Asian, <styles, periods, and cultures by region>, Styles and Periods (hierarchy name), Styles and Periods Facet

There are several Zirid buildings in Granada, including a palace (1052-6) on the site of the Alhambra erected by Yusuf ibn Naghrallah, the Zirid's Jewish vizier. The only remains of this splendid palace are 12 white marble lions, reused in the 14th century for the central fountain in the Palace of the Lions. Zirid patrons also furnished religious buildings; for example, a carved wooden minbar was given in 980 by the Zirid ruler Buluggin to the mosque of the Andalusians in Fez. The most important example of Zirid woodwork is the heavily carved maqsura ordered by al-Mu'izz ibn Badis for the congregational mosque at Kairouan; a carved inscription is outlined by a distinctively Zirid raised bead.

Gods or daivas are often associated with each class, though Zoroaster rejected the cults of all gods except the one of Ahura Mazda (the Wise Lord). Its characteristic principle is the belief that the origin of evil began in the exercise of free will at the nascent stage of creation in which the twin sons of Ahura Mazda, embittered in rivalry, chose different moral paths: Spent Mainyu (Bounteous Spirit) choose good; Angra Mainyu (Destructive Spirit) chose evil."@en	religions (belief systems, cultures), <religions and religious concepts>, Associated Concepts (hierarchy name), Associated Concepts Facet
